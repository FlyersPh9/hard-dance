After a hiatus far too long from the states, we’re bringing the legend back for one incredible night. Through his record label, Keeping The Rave Alive, podcast of the same name, and his own releases and incomparable sets, Kutski continues to make his mark on the world.

Don’t miss out on this once in a blue moon chance to see a figure of the scene at work! Be sure to get your fill of face time with a VIP meet & greet before the show! Get ready to crank the energy to 11 at Hardcore Haven! We’ll see you soon!
