On October 26th, we unleash another edition of Gabberland at Hemkade, our temple since the '90s. Prepare for soaring BPMs, dirty Nikes, and sweat-drenched tracksuits ðŸ’¥

Gabberland is for those who crave the harder edge of dance music, the devoted members of the Hardcore community. We build upon the raw foundations of the past, a gathering that delves deep into the true essence of Gabber culture. Tickets are available now.

The doctrine is simple:

Our religion of choice is Hardcore  
Our emotional state of choice is ecstasy  
Our politics of choice is none

Gabberland  
October 26th  
14:00 - 01:00  
Hemkade, Zaandam

Gabberland is forged by Hellbound, Ouwe Stijl is Botergeil and PRSPCT.
