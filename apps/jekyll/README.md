## Getting started

Want to help make Hard.Dance bigger and better? We're an open source repository and would like to collaborate with you! There's a couple of ways that you can contribute:

### Add missing events

Go to [the `/_posts/` folder](https://github.com/Hard-Dance/hard-dance/tree/main/_posts), copy a pre-existing event, fill it out, and submit a pull request. We've also setup a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/FlyersPh9/213838b27f8d5215834ab96559199861) which provides a blank template, an example file, and instructions, no coding knowledge required!

### Add missing event hosts

Go to [the `_config.yml` file](https://github.com/Hard-Dance/hard-dance/blob/main/_config.yml) and add the event host's name, website URL (if they have one), and Facebook URL. While not necessary, it would be nice if you also added the host's icon to [the `/assets/hosts.svg` file](https://github.com/Hard-Dance/hard-dance/blob/main/assets/hosts.svg?short_path=376e9fa).

### Site wide contributions

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), you can find the install instructions and prerequisites on their site. When working locally, some parts of the site may not function completely such as the Google Maps embed on event pages. To get this working locally you must [reach out to me](https://github.com/FlyersPh9) to acquire an `.env` file.

## Want to support Hard.Dance?

This is a hobby project for the love of the hard dance music scene. We make no money off this site yet we do have fees for things like the domain name and if the traffic increases we may have additional fees.
