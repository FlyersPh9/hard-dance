Want to help make Hard.Dance bigger and better? We're an open source repository and would like to collaborate with you! There's 2 ways that you can contribute:

### Add missing events

We've setup a GitHub Gist to give you an easy template to fill out, no coding knowledge required!

### Site wide contributions

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), you can find the install instructions and prerequisites on their site.
