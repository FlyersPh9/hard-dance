EMBRYON : Outdoor Trilogy Finale  
Saturday August 3 2024

  

Our quest is simple - bring you what others don't. Our sounds are unrelenting. Our locations completely different. You could do the usual, or you could be part of the underground.

For years we've been asked to do an outdoors. To do something everyone could attend. We've already done two this season and it's time to do the last.

If you've ever been to an outdoor event, you know that volume is always an issue, so we've got a solution - your ticket includes a deposit that gets you a pair of headphones we'll be wirelessly transmitting to and you can crank them as loud as you want! Walk around, dance hard, socialize and when you return your headset, we'll send you back the deposit portion of your ticket! If you'd like to support future events, you can also opt to skip the deposit return. We'd appreciate it, but that's entirely your call.

EVENT INFO:  
Landing & Takeoff: 10pmish-late

Venue info will be emailed to all ticket holders. Reach out to individual DJs if you haven't bought a ticket.

Very limited quantities of headsets are available. Others are invited to attend, but headsets cannot be guaranteed. If you want the full experience, grab a ticket in advance or bring cash and/or a drivers license as deposit.

Ticket price includes $20 deposit returned once you return your assigned headset in good working order. Refunds may take approximately 48 hours to be processed on our end. You can also select the non-refund option in order to help fund future events.

Event takes place in Toronto CANADA. Parking available, but be smart - don't park too close, be quiet coming in, be quiet coming out. 24hr TTC routes are nearby.
